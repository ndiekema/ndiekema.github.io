        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            As a final project for one of my software engineering classes at Cal Poly, we were tasked with designing and creating a
            website of our choice. Our team decided to design an e-commerce website similar to that of craigslist. The whole idea
            was to have a simple platform where you can buy and/or sell items locally. One of our main focuses was on the
            user-interface. We wanted to appeal to users by offering a simple, intuitive, user-friendly interface. Take a look at
            our initial UI prototypes through figma which can be found at the bottom of this page. A use case diagram describing a
            top-level diagram of user interactions on our site is found below.

            Users are able to post listings of items they are trying to sell to an end user. When first loading into the website,
            you are prompted to login, sign up, or continue as a guest. In order to actually buy or sell an item you must be logged
            into an account. However, you are still able to view all listings as a “guest”, but to interact with listings you are
            required to make an account. Users are also able to filter listing by category, which is done by selecting one of the
            options on the side menu as seen in the screenshots below.You can hover over the information icon to get additional 
            information on each posting. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This website was built using React for frontend, and Flask for backend. We used a MongoDB database to store information
            about user accounts and listings. The database design can be found in the image above. The frontend design was first
            modeled in figma before implementing. The figma and github links are available at the bottom of the page.

        <p>
            This project served as a nice introduction to web design, specifically the intricacies of React, Flask, and MongoDB.
            I'm well aware this website is quite bare-bones and lackluster. However, I've included it in my portfolio because
            I consider it to be a great learning experience with exposure to tools that I've never used before. Moreover, the 
            project was completed in an agile workflow which is a methodology many companies use nowadays.
